                <h3>Predictive Analytics for Patient Outcomes</h3>
                <p>This project developed predictive models using electronic health records to identify patients at risk of complications and readmission. By analysing lifestyle factors, genetic data and past medical history, the model provides early warnings that enable clinicians to deliver personalised preventative care.</p>

                <h3>Deep Learning for Medical Imaging</h3>
                <p>A convolutional neural network was trained to detect tumours in MRI and CT scans, demonstrating high sensitivity for early‑stage cancers. The network learns subtle patterns and correlations that radiologists may miss, supporting early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.</p>

                <h3>Interactive Dashboard for Healthcare Data</h3>
                <p>Built an interactive dashboard that visualises trends in chronic disease prevalence using modern visualisation techniques. The tool helps clinicians and administrators identify patterns, outliers and future trends, making complex health data easy to interpret and act upon.</p>

        <h2>Research &amp; Insights</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is poised to fundamentally transform medicine and healthcare delivery. Recent reviews highlight how AI systems—particularly machine learning and deep learning—can analyse multimodal data, recognise complex patterns and augment clinical decision‑making. Predictive healthcare models already identify trends and subtle abnormalities that escape even experienced professionals, supporting early diagnosis, personalised treatment and improved outcomes.</p>
        <p>In addition to model development, it is essential to design AI systems that are trusted, reliable and human‑centred. Experts emphasise that AI augments rather than replaces clinicians, and effective systems must be developed with careful consideration of workflows, user needs and ethical implications.</p>
        <h3>Data Visualisation in Healthcare</h3>
        <p>Healthcare generates massive volumes of data that need to be translated into actionable insights. Data visualisation techniques—graphs, charts and interactive dashboards—enable clinicians, administrators and patients to quickly identify trends, outliers and patterns. Visualisation improves understanding of past and present trends and helps predict future directions, supporting evidence‑based practice and improved patient safety.</p>
        <p>This portfolio includes an interactive visualisation demonstrating how the number of AI‑related publications in healthcare has grown over recent years. Scroll down to explore the chart.</p>
